# My First Android App

## Getting the setup ready
### Install android studio:
* https://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html
* Course - https://www.udacity.com/course/how-to-install-android-studio--ud808

### Emulator
Emulators make life easy (sometimes) and Genymotion is one of the nicest emulators out there.

* NOTE: I strongly recommended using real android device for testing the app

### Showing-off your demo
To showcase the work you did, creating png screen recording is one of the most portable ways.
* Check out LICEcap - recording screen. - http://www.cockos.com/licecap/.

### Chrome extensions
I highly recommend using browser extensions - XML and JSON viewer.  
Simply google it and install whichever you like.
